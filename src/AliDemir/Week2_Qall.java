1Ô∏è‚É£ **Numbers -- Swap Numbers**
Swap two variable values without using a third variable

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Numbers -- Divisible by 3, 5, 15**
Write a program that can print the numbers between 1 ~ 100 that can be divisible by 3, 5, and 15.
-if the number can be divisible by 3, 5 and 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy15 section
-if the number can be divisible by 3 but cannot be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy3 section
-if the number can be divisible by 5 but cannot be divisible by 15, then it should only be displayed in DivisibelBy5 section
ex:
OutPut:
Divisible By 15 15 30 45 60 75 90
Divisible By 5 5 10 20 25 35 40 50 55 65 70 80 85 95 100
Divisible By 3 3 6 9 12 18 21 24 27 33 36 39 42 48 51 54 57 63 66 69 72 78 81 84 87 93 96 99

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Numbers -- print consecutive numbers**
Write a function that, given a positive integer N, prints the consecutive numbers from 1 to N, each on a separate line. However, any number divisible by 2, 3 or 5 should be replaced by the word Codility, Test or Coders respectively. If a number is divisible by more than one of the numbers: 2,3 or 5, it should be replaced by a concatenation of the respective words Codility, Test and Coders in this given order. For example, numbers divisible by both 2 and 3 should be replaced by CodilityTest and numbers divisible by all three numbers: 2,3 and 5, should be replaced by CodilityTestCoders.

For example, here is the output for N = 17:
1
Codility
Test
Codility
Coders
CodilityTest
7
Codility
Test
CodilityCoders
11
CodilityTest
13
Codility
TestCoders
Codility
17
üéâ Happy Coding to all ü•≥
